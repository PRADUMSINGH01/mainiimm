          <li><strong>Original Content Investment:</strong> Starting with 'House of Cards' (2013), Netflix moved aggressively into producing its own high-quality, exclusive content ('Originals') to differentiate, attract subscribers, and gain negotiating leverage against traditional studios.</li>
          <li><strong>Global Expansion:</strong> A phased rollout across the globe, eventually reaching over 190 countries. Involved significant investment in content localization (dubbing, subtitles) and navigating diverse regulatory environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Data-Driven Personalization:</strong> Utilizing sophisticated algorithms to analyze viewing habits, personalize recommendations, tailor artwork, and even inform greenlighting decisions for new content.</li>
          <li><strong>Binge Model Pioneer:</strong> Releasing entire seasons at once catered to changing viewer habits and became a defining feature, although now experimenting with weekly releases for some shows.</li>
          <li><strong>Tiered Subscription & Ad-Support:</strong> Introducing different subscription price points and an ad-supported tier to broaden market appeal and boost ARPU.</li>
          <li><strong>Password Sharing Crackdown:</strong> Implementing measures to convert non-paying viewers into subscribers or 'extra member' fees, boosting revenue.</li>

        <p>Netflix's success is deeply intertwined with its ability to understand and leverage consumer behavior through data analytics.</p>
        <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">Data-Driven Approach:</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Viewing Data Analysis:</strong> Tracks what users watch, when, for how long, on what devices, completion rates, searches, ratings, etc. (anonymized and aggregated).</li>

          <li><strong>Content Greenlighting:</strong> While not solely reliant on data, viewing patterns inform decisions about commissioning new seasons, investing in certain genres, or acquiring specific types of licensed content likely to resonate with audience segments.</li>
          <li><strong>A/B Testing:</strong> Constantly tests different user interface elements, artwork, trailers, and recommendation strategies to optimize engagement.</li>

          <li><strong>The 'Binge Model':</strong> Recognized and capitalized on the desire for viewers to watch multiple episodes sequentially, fostering cultural moments and deep engagement.</li>
          <li><strong>Global Taste Clusters:</strong> Identifies common viewing preferences across different countries, enabling promotion of international content globally (e.g., 'Squid Game', 'Money Heist').</li>
          <li><strong>User Interface Focus:</strong> Prioritizes a simple, intuitive interface that reduces friction in finding and playing content.</li>
