        The Humble Beginnings: The Garage Era
      </h1>
      <p className="p-2  text-lg bg-white text-black">
        Founding Story : In 1976, in a modest garage in Los Altos, California,
        two young visionaries—Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak—along with a brief
        involvement by Ronald Wayne, took a giant leap into the unknown. While
        Jobs had the knack for spotting opportunities and telling compelling
        stories, Wozniak was the technical wizard behind the scenes. Their
        shared passion for technology and innovation set the stage for what
        would become one of the world’s most influential companies.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          In those early days, funding was scarce. The duo often had to
          improvise with limited resources—purchasing parts piecemeal and
          working around the clock in a cramped garage.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Personal computers were a novel idea. They faced the uphill battle of
          convincing investors, retailers, and potential customers that a
          computer designed for personal use could be both practical and
          desirable.

          The Apple I was more than just a circuit board—it was a pioneering
          step toward making computing accessible to hobbyists and early
          adopters. Wozniak built the machine largely by hand, while Jobs saw
          the potential for a product that could revolutionize the market.

          {" "}
          Although sold as a kit (requiring users to add their own case, power
          supply, and keyboard), the Apple I generated the first streams of
          revenue. This income, modest as it was, validated their efforts and
          encouraged them to push further.

          Learning from the challenges of the Apple I, the team developed the
          Apple II in 1977—a complete, ready-to-use personal computer. Its
          innovative features, like color graphics and a more user-friendly
          design, resonated with a broader audience, marking the beginning of
          substantial revenue growth

          expansion.

      <div className="flex flex-col m-3 p-3">
        <span className="font-bold">A Unique Blend of Art and Technology</span>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Even in Apple’s nascent days, Jobs was determined to blend
          cutting-edge technology with elegant design. His appreciation for
          calligraphy, art, and Zen Buddhism played a crucial role in shaping
          the company’s aesthetic and philosophy—“technology infused with
          liberal arts.”
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col p-3 m-3">
        <span className="font-bold">Daily Discipline</span>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          <span className="uppercase ">Intense Focus:</span> Jobs was known for
          his relentless work ethic. Stories from that era tell of long days in
          the garage, where he would push boundaries, challenge conventional
          thinking, and expect nothing short of perfection from himself and his
          team. The ‘Reality Distortion Field’: Colleagues often remarked how
          Jobs’ persuasive charisma could inspire his team to achieve what
          seemed impossible. His ability to frame challenges in a way that made
          them appear surmountable became a hallmark of his leadership style.
          Mindfulness and Reflection: Even amidst the chaos of a startup, Jobs
          practiced routines that kept his creativity alive. He was known to
          take time for quiet reflection and meditation, helping him focus on
          the bigger picture even when details were demanding.

      <div className="flex flex-col m-3 p-3">
        <p className="first-letter:text-2xl m-2">
          Perfectionism with a Purpose: Jobs was famously meticulous, often
          scrutinizing even the smallest design elements. His philosophy was
          that the beauty of a product lay in its simplicity and functionality—a
          belief that transformed how products were designed not just at Apple,
          but across the tech industry.
        </p>

        <p className="first-letter:text-2xl m-2">
          Storytelling as Strategy: Whether unveiling a new product or rallying
          his team, Jobs used storytelling to connect emotionally with his
          audience. He believed that products should not only work flawlessly
          but also resonate with people on a personal level.
        </p>
        <p className="first-letter:text-2xl m-2">
          Embracing Risk and Failure: The early years were fraught with
          uncertainty. Jobs’ willingness to take risks, learn from failures, and
          iterate quickly was critical in turning Apple from a garage project
          into a burgeoning company with a clear vision for the future.
